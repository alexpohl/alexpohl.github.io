As a paleoclimate modeler, I try to understand how and why Earth’s climate changed in the past, especially in the deep time during pre-Cenozoic times, using a wide variety of numerical models. I currently focus on the co-evolution of marine Life and the physical environment at the geological timescale. My primary tool is the cGENIE Earth System Model, which I sometimes couple with marine biodiversity models.

I regularly open funded PhD or post-doc positions. Open applications are also very welcome, especially coming from students with clear goals and ideas in mind, and from post-docs interested in developing fellowship and grant proposals that would fund their work. Potential postdoctoral researchers are encouraged to contact me a year before their desired start-date, to allow time to develop these proposals.

I am also very happy to train motivated bachelor and master students in Earth system modeling.
