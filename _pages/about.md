As a paleoclimate modeler, I try to understand how and why Earth’s climate changed in the past, especially in the deep time during pre-Cenozoic times, using a wide variety of numerical models. I currently focus on the co-evolution of marine Life and the physical environment at the geological timescale. My primary tool is the cGENIE Earth System Model, which I sometimes couple with marine biodiversity models.

I regularly open PhD and post-doc positions. I also welcome open applications from PhD students with clear goals in mind, and from post-docs interested in developing (e.g., Marie-Curie) fellowships that would fund their own work. Potential post-doc candidates are invited to contact me a year before desired start date to leave some time to develop the grant application.

I am also always very happy to train motivated bachelor and master students in Earth system modeling.
