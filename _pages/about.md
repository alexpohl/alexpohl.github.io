As a paleoclimate modeler, I try to understand how and why Earth’s climate changed in the past, especially in the deep time during pre-Cenozoic times. 

I currently focus on the co-evolution of marine Life and the physical environment at the geological timescale. My primary tool is the EcoGENIE Earth System Model, which I use to study the links between marine planktonic communities and oceanic oxygenation during the Phanerozoic.

I work between University of California Riverside (Riverside, CA, USA) and the Biogéosciences Research Lab (Dijon, France), with [Andy Ridgwell](https://www.seao2.info/){:target="\_blank"} and [Emmanuelle Pucéat](http://emmanuelle.puceat.free.fr/){:target="\_blank"} .
