As a paleoclimate modeler, I try to understand how and why Earth’s climate changed in the past, especially in the deep time during pre-Cenozoic times, using a wide variety of numerical models. I currently focus on the co-evolution of marine Life and the physical environment at the geological timescale. My primary tool is the EcoGENIE Earth System Model, which I use to study the links between continental arrangement, oceanic oxygenation and marine biodiversity during the Phanerozoic.
