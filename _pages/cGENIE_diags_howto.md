- Python code hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexpohl/genie_basicdiags)

- Not much to add... Just type in `python basicdiag_genie_toPDF.py` to generate the PDF.

- You can change the cGENIE output directory and year plotted in the block named `USER_DEFINED OPTIONS`. More info in the script header.
