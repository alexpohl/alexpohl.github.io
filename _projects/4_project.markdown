<h2>Objective</h2>

Shallow-water carbonates represent an important component of the Earth System, located at the interface between the ocean-atmosphere system and the lithosphere. We here investigate the relationships between shallow-water carbonate sedimentation and climate. We notably developed a model predicting the spatial occurrence of platform carbonates, validated in both the Modern and the Early Cretaceous (Aptian; 120 Ma). Using an approach combining models and data, we also reconstructed the temporal trend in neritic carbonate production and sedimentation during the Cretaceous and its environmental drivers.
