<h2>Objective</h2>

The continental configuration significantly changed through geological times, characterized by the periodic assembly and breakup of supercontinents. These continental changes impact the Earth's albedo, the ocean circulation, the transport of heat to the poles, continental climate and weathering... and finally the Earth System as a whole. This research axis consists in quantifying this impact to improve our understanding of rthe evolution of Earth's climate during the Phanerozoic.
