<h2>Objective</h2>

I am presently focusing on the co-evolution of marine Life and the physical environment. Why did marine Life undergo such a drastic explosion and diversification during the Early Paleozoic? What drivers shaped its temporal evolution? I use the GENIE Earth System Model to simulate the evolution of the physical environment during the Phanerozoic, and the consequence on the marine biosphere at various temporal and spatial scales.
